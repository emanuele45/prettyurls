**Pretty URLs** is a URL management package for [Simple Machine Forums](http://simplemachines.org) (SMF).

It is simple, powerful, extensible and free. Most of all, it is pretty! Its main purpose is to rewrite the important SMF URLs, like these:

  * `http://domain.com/board/topic/`
  * `http://domain.com/profile/user/`
  * `http://domain.com/unreadreplies/`

Pretty URLs will work with SMF 1.1 and 2.0. It requires an Apache webserver with support for mod\_rewrite and .htaccess files.
